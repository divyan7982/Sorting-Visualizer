# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This web application, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows you to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

## Purpose

I developed this sorting visualizer to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also providing a useful tool for beginners in programming. By visualizing these sorting algorithms, users can gain a deeper understanding of how they work, enhancing their learning experience.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

This application includes visualizations for the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Insertion Sort**
3. **Selection Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**

## Features

- Interactive and dynamic visualizations
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed
- Step-by-step animation to illustrate the sorting process
- Educational tool to learn and understand sorting algorithms
